# veRELAY Token

## veRELAY Token

A user staking or locking RELAY tokens in the RelayChain app, on Arbitrum generates veRELAY tokens available for claim to the same wallet. Users must claim their veRELAY tokens to receive any benefits of holding veRELAY.

When locking RELAY, the user will only need to claim veRELAY once since the veRELAY is awarded instantly upon locking. When staking RELAY, the user needs to claim veRELAY frequently since veRELAY accumulates over time.

Claimed veRELAY tokens remain in that wallet until the user unstakes or unlocks any RELAY, in which case they will lose all of their veRELAY and all of the benefits associated with it.

### veRELAY Benefits

Holding veRELAY affords several benefits to users:

* Receive a share of protocol fees.
* On Arbitrum, users gain an airdrop modifier and a share of future generated fees,
* Obtain extra entries to the weekly lottery and access to airdrops, and more.
