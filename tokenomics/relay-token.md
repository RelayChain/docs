# RELAY Token

### RELAY Token

The RELAY token is at the center of the project and holds multiple utilities that will reward users: Earn veRELAY, stake to earn a portion of bridge revenues.&#x20;

A user staking or locking RELAY tokens in the RelayChain app generates veRELAY tokens available for claim to the same wallet. Claimed veRELAY tokens remain in that wallet until the user unstakes or unlocks any RELAY, in which case they will lose all of their veRELAY and all of the benefits associated with it.
