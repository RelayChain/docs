# Referrals

The Bridge Referral Program is designed to reward our community for sharing RelayChain with others. The referral program has two parts: the referrer and the referee. When you refer a user to our platform, both you and the user receive rewards.&#x20;

**The Referrer:** Generate a referral code from our referral page and share it with your friends to use during their bridge transactions. As the referrer, you will receive a fee split from the aggregator's fees, in addition to an airdrop modifier for each successful transaction.&#x20;

**The Referee:** Enter a referral code during a bridge transaction to receive an additional Bridge & Win ticket which increases your chances of winning in our weekly draws. To participate, simply use a referrer's link.

The referral program incentivizes users to invite their friends to join the community while also rewarding them for doing so.&#x20;
