# Bridge & Win

Simply perform any bridge transaction to any blockchain and you will receive a ticket. Then, check the countdown on our website to see when the draw will take place, and, after the draw, check if you've won and claim your prize.

All RelayChain bridge transactions automatically receive one entry. The prize pool for each draw period comes from two sources: our Relay Treasury, which contributes RELAY tokens, and the DeFi infusion, which randomly injects tokens obtained via bridge fees and promotional sources.

There are 10 winners per one-week draw period, and any unclaimed winnings are forfeited after 30 days and returned to the prize pool for future draws.
