# Fees

Fees will be dispersed according to the Airdrop Leaderboard position. Participants on the Leaderboard will receive a share of the fees based on their ranking. This distribution ensures that those who perform well and contribute to the community are rewarded accordingly. We believe that this approach fosters a healthy and thriving community of stakeholders who are invested in the long-term success of RelayChain."
