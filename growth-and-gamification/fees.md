  RelayChain aims to create a sustainable ecosystem for all users. To achieve
  this goal, we collect a nominal fee on every transaction made on our platform.

# Fees

Fees will be dispersed in thirds, with one-third going to our Referral program, one-third to RELAY token stakers and one-third to the Relay treasury. In the event that there are no referrals, the fees will be divided equally between RELAY token stakers and the Relay treasury. We believe that this approach will help to create a healthy and thriving community of stakeholders who are invested in the long-term success of RelayChain.
