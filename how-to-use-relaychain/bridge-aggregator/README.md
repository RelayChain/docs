# Relay Aggregator

The aggregator connects users with liquidity from top bridging protocols—at present, Synapse, Multichain, Celer, Stargate and Hop—and always selects the most economical path.

### What does the Relay aggregator do?

RelayChain’s aggregator finds and uses the optimal bridge path based on the token and chain selections using automated algorithms, resulting in cost and time savings for end users and thereby opening up new opportunities to trade, farm yield, and arbitrage. This path is identified and used automatically.

### How do I use the aggregator?

All users conducting a bridge or bridge & swap transaction on RelayChain will automatically use the bridge aggregator; it is now built into Relay’s bridge user interface and is “always on.”

### Which route am I using when I execute a transaction on RelayChain?

Once you’ve chosen your token and chain, the RelayChain UI will inform you which route will be used prior to your confirmation. Upon executing a successful transaction, the UI will record this information in your history tab.

### How many chains and sources of liquidity does Relay access?

Users have access to 17 bridges and 28 exchanges. By utilizing these top bridges and exchanges, Relay can offer comprehensive access to various liquidity sources, providing users with a seamless and efficient trading experience. Below is a list of the bridges and exchanges that Relay can access:
