# Bridge Aggregator

The aggregator connects users with liquidity from top bridging protocols—at present, Synapse, Multichain, Celer, Stargate and Hop—and always selects the most economical path.

### What does the bridge aggregator do?

RelayChain’s bridge aggregator finds and uses the optimal bridge path based on the token and chain selections using automated algorithms, resulting in cost and time savings for end users and thereby opening up new opportunities to trade, farm yield, and arbitrage. This path is identified and used automatically.

### How do I use the aggregator?

All users conducting a bridge transaction on RelayChain will automatically use the bridge aggregator; it is now built into Relay’s bridge user interface and is “always on.”

### Which bridge am I using when I execute a bridge transaction on RelayChain

Once you’ve chosen your token and chain, the RelayChain UI will inform you which bridge will be used prior to your confirmation. Upon executing a successful transaction, the UI will record this information in your history tab.
