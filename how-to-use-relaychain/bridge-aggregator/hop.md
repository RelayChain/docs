# Hop

The Hop Bridge is a decentralized protocol that allows for cross-chain asset transfers between different blockchain networks. It enables the transfer of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and tokens, in a trustless and secure manner using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Hop Bridge is built on top of the Ethereum network and is designed to enable greater interoperability between different blockchain networks, including Cosmos, Polkadot, and Binance Smart Chain, among others. The Hop Bridge protocol helps to unlock the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications by enabling the seamless exchange of assets between different blockchain ecosystems.
