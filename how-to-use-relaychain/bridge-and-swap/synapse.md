# Synapse

Synapse is a cross-chain liquidity protocol that utilizes a unique approach to enable bridge and swap functionality across multiple blockchain networks. It achieves this by creating its own liquidity pools, which are accessible to users looking to trade or transfer assets across different blockchain networks and allows the trade and transfer assets across different blockchain networks in a single transaction. These liquidity pools enable Synapse to offer competitive prices for users and make it easier for them to find the liquidity they need for their trades.
