# Celer

The Celer Network Bridge uses a Layer-2 scaling solution to facilitate near-instant transactions with minimal fees, making it ideal for micro-transactions and other low-value exchanges. The Celer Network Bridge is built on top of the Ethereum network and uses the Plasma scaling technology to enable cross-chain asset transfers in a trustless and secure manner. The protocol supports a range of different blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Polkadot, among others. The Celer Network Bridge is designed to enable greater interoperability between different blockchain networks, helping to unlock the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain-based solutions.
