## What is RelayChain? <a href="#h.wfetwllh69w6" id="h.wfetwllh69w6"></a>

### **Overview**

RelayChain is a [dApp](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1680153724482551\&usg=AOvVaw2P33d7HC\_-yIBHFSG9ZBHt) that optimizes cross-chain token transfers and swaps by aggregating bridge liquidity between the worldâ€™s leading blockchains. We aggregate from multiple bridges and DEXs to ensure the best cross-chain experience, and lowest cost, for users.

RelayChain has combined bridge aggregation with swap functionality into a single, simple UI. Powered by its best-in-class bridge aggregator, RelayChain allows traders to reach many markets simultaneously by bringing new trading and investment opportunities. No matter your goals, RelayChain means traders can move crypto between many blockchains with simplicity, security, and speed, making cross-chain DeFi accessible, finally.

Not only does RelayChain simplify the bridging process, it also gamifies it. Each bridge transaction qualifies users for entry into a [Bridge & Win](growth-and-gamification/bridge-and-win.md) weekly drawing and the [Airdrop](growth-and-gamification/airdrop-seasons.md) campaign, providing additional incentives for using the platform. Furthermore, by [Referring ](growth-and-gamification/referrals.md)friends, users can earn even more rewards and participate in the network's growth. So, if you want more than just seamless bridging, RelayChain offers a chance to participate in a fun, rewarding, and community-driven ecosystem.

### **Objectives**

* Fast: Allow users to enjoy a stress-free bridging experience and execute upon transient investment opportunities.
* Peace of Mind: RelayChain is secure and safe. Our code and smart contracts have been audited 3 times (the ChainSafe foundation by Consensys Diligence, Zokyo, and a full security audit by TevPro.&#x20;
* Cheap: Deliver outstanding, capitally-efficient bridging services to projects integrating our bridges and individual DeFi users.
* Easy: Weâ€™ve combined bridge aggregation with swap functionality into a single, simple UI.
* Reliable: No loss of funds and automatic processing of stuck transactions.
* Sustainable: RelayChain and RELAY tokenomics are built to reinforce the growth of the protocol and its community.
* Rewarding: The biggest benefits go to the protocolâ€™s biggest supporters, as it should be. Even individual bridge users, though, can see significant rewards through the features of [Growth & Gamification.](growth-and-gamification/)

### **How It Works**

The new v3 design incorporates a bridge aggregator and a single-transaction bridge & swap function. The aggregator connects users with liquidity from top bridging protocolsâ€”at launch, Synapse, Multichain, Celer, and Hopâ€”and always selects the most economical path. The bridge & swap function is built on Squid on Axelar. The result is a faster, more secure, and cheaper bridging process.

Users can also swap directly through the new UI.

### **The RELAY Token**

The RELAY token is at the center of the project and holds multiple utilities that reward users. With the v2 staking contract, users can now obtain veRELAY by staking and locking RELAY tokens. Staking RELAY earns users a portion of protocol fees and qualifies for additional [Airdrop ](growth-and-gamification/airdrop-seasons.md)allocation.&#x20;

### **Innovations**

**V1:** At its launch in 2021, Relay Chainâ€™s (formerly Zero Exchange) methodology was similar to most other crypto bridges in that it relied on smart contracts to execute cross-chain transfers. At its core, it used ChainSafe technology to create a simple burn/mint mechanism.&#x20;



**V2**: After a year of operation, market observations, community feedback and seeing other smart contract bridges repeatedly hacked and exploited led the Relay team to reconsider their approach to bridging. In August 2022 the team merged the best time-tested practices of Web 2 with the transparency, convenience and indelibility of Web 3, Relay developed a hybrid system of bridging to create a secure, best-in-class user experience.&#x20;

The new v2 design also incorporated a bridge aggregator. The aggregator connects users with liquidity from top bridging protocolsâ€”at launch, Synapse, Multichain, Celer, and Hopâ€”and always selects the most economical path. The result is a faster, more secure, and cheaper bridging process.



**V3**: RelayChain's latest innovation is the Bridge & Swap. This solution provides users with a streamlined and efficient way to bridge and swap assets across multiple blockchain networks in a single transaction.

The RelayChain Bridge & Swap is a big step towards realizing RelayChain's vision of making decentralized finance accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise. This innovative technology represents a significant advancement in cross-chain interoperability and is set to transform the way we exchange value in the blockchain ecosystem.

Bridge & Swap connects users with liquidity from top bridging protocolsâ€”at present, Squid & Synapseâ€”with a forthcoming solution provide directly by the RelayChain bridge. &#x20;
